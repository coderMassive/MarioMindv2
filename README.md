# MarioMind: AI Plays Super Mario Bros
### What are these files?
train.py trains a new model that will be saved in tmp/best_model.zip
test.py generates a video of the model (from tmp/best_model.zip) playing to output.mp4
live.py runs the model (from tmp/best_model.zip) live instead of saving to a video
the other files are helper classes
